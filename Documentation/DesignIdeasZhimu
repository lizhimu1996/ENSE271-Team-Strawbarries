1. The good understandability and discoverability makes better and clean design. In lo-fo and sitemap, I added some detailed info to improve the MVP design.
2. “You are not equal to User”. Because I never used the Food Bank before, then I tried to use the web twice and looking for some potential advices for my design. The users are respectively from different fields and work with software in different situations, users’ experience cannot be as same as designer expected.
3. In interface design metaphors section, there are respectively two Do’s and Don’t list. For this reason, I change some my original ideas and cancel some detailed user info section.
